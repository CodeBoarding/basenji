## Component Details



The `basenji` project is designed for deep learning analysis of genomic sequences, primarily focusing on building and applying the SeqNN neural network model. The main flow involves preparing genomic data, constructing and training the SeqNN model, evaluating its performance, and interpreting its predictions to understand genomic feature importance. The project provides a comprehensive set of tools for data handling, model development, and result visualization.



### SeqNN Model Core

This component embodies the fundamental neural network architecture, `SeqNN`, responsible for constructing, managing, and executing the deep learning model. It performs core operations such as prediction and integrates various custom layers and building blocks to define the computational graph for sequence analysis.
